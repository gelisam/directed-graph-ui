Click in the open space to **add a state**, drag from one state to another to **add a transition**.  
Click a state or a transition to **select** it.

When a state is selected: **R** toggles reflexivity, **Delete** removes the state.  
When a transition is selected: **L**(eft), **R**(ight), **B**(oth) change direction, **Delete** removes the transition.
